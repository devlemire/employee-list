# Project Summary

In this project we will take a look at an employee management application and learn how it works. We will cover the following topics by going through each stage and building out a part of the application all the way up to the black diamond where you will build the entire application from nothing: 

* State
* Props
* JavaScript Classes
* .bind
* this
* componentWillReceiveProps ( React life cycle method )

We can control which stage we are on by using `index.js` in the `src/` directory. On lines 3 and 4 in `index.js` you should see:

```js
// Stage 1 - 5
import App from './Stage 1/App';
```

We can change stages by changing the number in the string. For example if I wanted stage 2, I would do: 

```js
import App from './Stage 2/App';
```

## Setup

* Run `npm install` in the root directory
* Run `npm start` to spin up a development server

## Stage 1

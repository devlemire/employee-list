# Project Summary

In this project we will take a look at a basic employee management interface and learn how it works. We will cover the following topics by going through each stage and building out a part of the application all the way up to the black diamond where you will build the entire application from nothing: 

* State
* Props
* JavaScript Classes
* .bind
* this
* componentWillReceiveProps ( React life cycle method )
